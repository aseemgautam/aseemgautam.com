One of the key challanges was to optimize performance using a **midstate** in SHA256 calculation in proof of work (POW) algorithm.

Bitcoin POW relies on performing a SHA256 hash on the incoming data. 
The **midstate** is the SHA-256 hashing state after hashing the first chunk (64) bytes of the block header. After you get a block header from the
server, you typically hash the first chunk 1 time, and hash the second chunk 2^32 times going through all the possible nonce values.
Because the nonce is in the second chunk, there is no need to hash the first chunk over and over every time you try a new nonce value.
