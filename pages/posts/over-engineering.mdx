</Head>

Over-engineering is a common pitfall in software development, especially in early-stage projects where many features & optimizations are yet to be built.

One way to address this is to ...

"explicitly have Non-Goals or Out of Scope on tickets/projects."

It could be a sub-section of a story, with points like "performance is not a concern at this time", "extensibility is not a concern at this time", or "custom error handling is not needed at this time" or "supporting concurrent updates is not a goal of this change."

But this should be done by technical leaders who understand where things might get over engineered, not project managers, who are mostly concerned with velocity.

And finally, don't over do it :)
