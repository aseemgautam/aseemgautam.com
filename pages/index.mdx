# Aseem Gautam

### Hello
I am creative, hands-on developer who is passionate about software engineering, building products that are easy to use, delight users and solve real world problems.
I have a diverse work experience from building complex products like trading systems, bitcoin miner to working as CTO for a funded startup. 

My last official gig was working as an technical architect + lead (Frontend) of a multi million $ mobile app build in React Native.

Some of my side projects include - <a href="https://imagecompressor.io">ImageCompressor.io</a>, <a href="https://covidtracking.in">CovidTracking.in</a>
