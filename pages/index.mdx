# Aseem Gautam

### Hello

I am a creative & curious software engineer who loves building, more importantly shipping products that are easy to use, delight users and solve real world problems. Though not a designer by profession, I have keen interest in application & software design, usability & UX.

Started programming & graphic design in high school (1997).

Professionally, I have a diverse work experience (>15 years) from building complex products like forex trading systems, a bitcoin miner, working as a technical architect & lead for a dynamic enterprise react native application to a CTO for a funded startup.

## WORKING STYLE

Obsess over customer experience & UI/UX. Even as a CTO at 91springboard, I would still take time to read (sometimes answer) intercom queries about the system we had built. Extracted useful insights & features from those. Even as a consultant I always try to talk to end-users & get a deep perspective of things.

Demonstrates judgment when advising and communicating outwards.

Unrelenting grit & integrity. Always try to give the right advice (gently) & do the right thing (when no ones looking) at the same time open to alternative solutions.

Strongly believe in disagree & commit.

Very excited about technology in general. I remember going to a building on 26th January to create a virtual tour using matterport while as a CTO. Idea was to actually assess how much effort it takes before we make it a standardized process. It's important to eat your own cake.

Love empowering, developing & helping people. It’s a great joy to see people deliver results with utter happiness when they thought goals were challanging & sometimes impossible (due to complexity or lack of domain knowledge).
