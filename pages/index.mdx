# Aseem Gautam

### Hello

I am a self taught coder who's been programming since high school (1997).

Professionally, I have been an entrepreneur and CTO for more than 16 years and have successfully led and motivated teams of 5-15+ members through several product launches. The journey has been incredible, with numerous challenges and opportunities to learn. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today.

My professional experience is diverse and includes building trading systems, bitcoin miner, leading an enterprise mobile app team & serving as CTO for a funded startup.

Currently, I help international companies expand their remote engineering teams in India through my company, [Stackway](https://stackway.io).
