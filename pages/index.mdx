# Aseem Gautam

### Hello

I am creative, hands-on developer who is passionate about software engineering, building products that are easy to use, delight users and solve real world problems.
Though not a designer by profession, I have keen interest in usability & user experience (application/software design). 

Started programming & graphic design in high school (1997).  

Professionally, I have a diverse work experience (~15 years) from building products like forex trading systems, bitcoin miner to working as CTO for a funded startup. 

Recently I worked as a technical architect (& lead) of a multi million $ mobile app build in React Native for STC (Saudi Telecom Company). At present I am helping a few
international companies build their engineering teams.
