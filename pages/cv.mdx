### 01 Technical Architect & Team Lead - TAWAL SA, June 2021 - Jan 2022
(Technical Architecture, System Design, React Native, TypeScript, MobX, Shopify ReStyle)

Enterprise mobile application in react native built on top of camunda business process automation engine. Most parts of the application were dynamic (rendered on the fly) in nature. I was responsible for overall delivery of the mobile app.

- Architected the core UI component library of buttons, datepicker, checkbox groups, select, tree, layouts, skeletons/content loaders etc
- Architected the design system using shopify restyle which eliminated the use of inline styles & css/scss.
- Implemented devops best practices - coding standards, low level design, code reviews, unit testing, security testing etc. 
- Introduced shift left testing where we would have multiple releases for every feature in a sprint. This helped tremendously as bugs were identified earlier rather than at the end of the sprint.
- Trained the team on Low Level Design. It was used extensively in sprint planning & feature scoping.
- Helped create a good culture where everyone was honest, open & ready to ask for help/feedback.
