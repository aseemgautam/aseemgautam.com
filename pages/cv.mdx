# Curriculum Vitae

## ABOUT

With over 15 years of experience as an entrepreneur and CTO, I have led and inspired teams of 5-15+ members through multiple product launches. It has been an incredible journey, full of challenges and learning opportunities,
but I am grateful for the experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today.

Professionally, I have diverse experience, including building forex trading systems and a bitcoin miner, leading technology for an enterprise mobile application and serving as CTO for a funded startup. I am a generalist in nature,
learning new things everyday.
