## ABOUT

I am a creative & curious software engineer who loves building, more importantly shipping products that are easy to use, delight users and solve real world problems. Though not a designer by profession, I have keen interest in application & software design, usability & UX.

Started programming & graphic design in high school (1997).

Professionally, I have a diverse work experience (>15 years) from building complex products like forex trading systems, a bitcoin miner, working as a technical architect & lead for a dynamic enterprise react native application to a CTO for a funded startup.

## WORKING STYLE

Obsess over customer experience & UI/UX. Even as a CTO at 91springboard, I would still take time to read (sometimes answer) intercom queries about the system we had built. Extracted useful insights & features from those. Even as a consultant I always try to talk to end-users & get a deep perspective of things.

Demonstrates judgment when advising and communicating outwards.

Unrelenting grit & integrity. Always try to give the right advice (gently) & do the right thing (when no ones looking) at the same time open to alternative solutions.

Strongly believe in disagree & commit.

Very excited about technology in general. I remember going to a building on 26th January to create a virtual tour using matterport while as a CTO. Idea was to actually assess how much effort it takes before we make it a standardized process. It's important to eat your own cake.

Love empowering, developing & helping people. It’s a great joy to see people deliver results with utter happiness when they thought goals were challanging & sometimes impossible (due to complexity or lack of domain knowledge).

## IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE

### 01 Technical Architect & Team Lead - TAWAL / Hidden Brains, June 2021 - Jan 2022
(Leadership, Technical Architecture, System Design, People Management, React Native, TypeScript)

Enterprise mobile application based on camunda business process automation engine. Most parts of the application were dynamic in nature. Rendered on the fly.

Lead a team of 8 people. Was responsible for overall delivery of the mobile app & all communications (presenting & explaining technical architectures, removing blockers, managing expectations etc) with TAWAL engineering team. 

Key Accomplishments -

- Created a good culture where everyone was honest & ready to ask for help/feedback.
- Delivered 7/8 sprints with sprint goal achieved from the product manager at TAWAL. Most important - this was accomplished within 9 working hours, no crunch :).
- Shift left testing where we would have multiple releases for every feature in a sprint. This helped tremendously as bugs were identified earlier rather than at the end of the sprint.
- Introduced LLD & it was used extensively in sprint planning.
- Convinced the TAWAL product owners to start off with a design system as the first UI/UX activity. As there was no 3rd party UI library used so it was important to create a design system before we start building any user interfaces. This helped us standardize the component library & have a clean codebase.
- Implemented best practices - coding standards, low level design, code reviews, shift left testing, honest retrospectives etc. 

### 02 CTO - 91springboard, Nov 2015 - February 2018
(Leadership, Technical Architecture, System Design, People Management, AngularJS,
Python, Investor Communication)

Lead the technology team to build an ecosystem of products that helped 91springboard scale effectively & efficiently. We built the core product that was used to run the coworking operations. This was used by more than 9000 members & 91springboard employees on a daily basis. Automated a lot of manual processes to save time, money & most importantly the mood of the colleagues.

Key Accomplishments

- Delivered the first release in 3 months after joining full time as a CTO. This included meeting room bookings, online payments and partially automated invoice generation. 
- GST was implemented on 1st July 2017. We had the system fully functional by 30th June Midnight. This was one moment everyone was proud of. By then I was a subject matter expert in GST :)
- Multi-tenant architecture scaled well to 10+ business centers & 9000+ members (2000+ companies).
- Solved complex issues like auth0 leeway, multiple bookings for the same resource (race condition) & business requirements like cut off the internet if an invoice is unpaid for 7 days.
- Developed multiple products by using services like Contentful (Help notes), Intercom (Support Ticketing), Quickbooks (Invoicing), google calendar (meeting room bookings) & Airtable (Partnerships). Not everything needs to be built from scratch. DRY is good.
- This was a unique situation where both the employees (internal)) and customers of 91sprinboard (external) were the end users. Kept everyone happy.

## 03 Offshore Manager - Kineo APAC & INX Software, June 2010 - Present

We manage a team of software test engineers. Over the years operations have been streamlined & my involvement is pretty much none. 

## 04 Freelancer, Peopleperhour, May 2014 -  Feb 2016

10+ Projects completed with 5 star ratings & 100% positive feedback. Never disappointed a customer :)

## 05 Software Engineer (Remote, UK) - B2Net, April 2011 - April 2014
(Windows Application, C#, DevExpress Controls, SQL Server, UI/UX)

Build various complex windows applications like frontend of a forex trading platform for Bank of Bulgaria, bitcoin miner, application to manage custom b2net windows services, financial stock charting etc.
