# Consulting

## Woking style

Obsess over customer experience & UI/UX. Even as a CTO at 91springboard, I would still take time to read (sometimes answer) intercom queries about the system we had built. Extracted useful insights & features from those.
Even as a consultant I always try to talk to end-users & get a deep perspective of things.

Demonstrates judgment when advising and communicating outwards.

Unrelenting grit & integrity. Always try to give the right advice (gently) & do the right thing (when no ones looking) at the same time open
to alternative solutions.

Strongly believe in disagree & commit.

Very excited about technology in general. I remember going to a building on 26th January to create a virtual tour using matterport while as a CTO. Idea was to actually assess how much effort it takes before we make it a standardized process. It's important to eat your own cake.
