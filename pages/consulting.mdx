Build vs Buy decisions, collaborating with business stakeholders to develop product requirements, help setting a technical vision for larger projects & provide guidance on continuous process improvements.

Strongly believe in disagree & commit.

Very excited about technology in general. I remember going to a building on 26th January to create a virtual tour using matterport while as a CTO. Idea was to actually assess how much effort it takes before we make it a standardized process.
